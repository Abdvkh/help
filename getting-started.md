# Getting started

##  How do I create a bot?

There's aâ€¦ bot for that. Just talk to [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather) and follow a few simple steps. You need your authorization token.

The **token** is a string along the lines of _`110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw`_ that is required to authorize the bot

Now go to app and fill this token in bot creation form.
