# Iterations. How to reduce theys?

All iterations on Bots.Business are paid. You can choose payment plan with different iterations count.

## What it is - "iteration"?

Each payment plan has its own iteration limit.

1 iteration it is:

* income message to bot
* [Bot.runCommand](https://help.bots.business/scenarios-and-bjs/bot-functions)\(command\) in the BJS spend 1 iteration
* Pressing the keyboard button
* Pressing the inline keyboard button
* 1 Auto Retry - it is 1 iteration

{% hint style="success" %}
Iterations are restored every month. Each payment plan has its own iteration limit.
{% endhint %}
