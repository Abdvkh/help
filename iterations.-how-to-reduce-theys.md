## What it is - "iteration"?

Each payment plan has its own iteration limit.

1 iteration it is:

* income message to bot
* [Bot.runCommand](https://help.bots.business/scenarios-and-bjs/bot-functions)\(command\) or Bot.run in the BJS spend 1 iteration
* Pressing the keyboard button
* Pressing the inline keyboard button
* 1 Auto Retry - it is 1 iteration
* 1 received webhook - it is 1 iteration
* **5** **sended message** on mass broadcasting - 1 iterations
* **5** **chats** on [Information refreshing](https://help.bots.business/bot-information) \(in Bot dashboard\) - spend 1 iterations
